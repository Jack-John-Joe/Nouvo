# The Complete Guide to Nouvo Notation

Nouvo notation simplifies music notation, making it accessible for beginners and seasoned musicians alike. This guide covers all the fundamental rules of Nouvo, complete with examples.

## Basics of Nouvo

### Pitches:
- **Letters A to E** represent pitches, with A being the highest and E the lowest.
- **Semitones**: To notate semitones, add an "F" to the letter. For example, "AF" represents a pitch between A and B.

### Rhythm:
- **Numbers** indicate the duration of a note in beats. In Nouvo, 1 beat is equivalent to 1 second.
- For example, "A2" means the A pitch is held for 2 beats.

## Detailed Rules and Examples

### 1. Pitch Notation:
- **Ascending Order**: A, B, C, D, E. Each letter represents a specific pitch, with "A" being the highest.
  - **Example**: "A" → High pitch, "E" → Low pitch.

### 2. Semitones:
- To indicate a note that falls between two pitches, add an "F" after the letter.
  - **Examples**:
    - "AF" (between A and B)
    - "BF" (between B and C)

### 3. Duration and Rhythm:
- Attach a number to the pitch letter to denote how long the note is held.
  - **Examples**:
    - "C2" = C note held for 2 beats.
    - "D4" = D note held for 4 beats.

### 4. Combining Pitches and Durations:
- You can create melodies by stringing together these notations.
  - **Melody Example**: A2 B2 AF2 B2 C3

### 5. Chords and Harmony:
- Stack letters vertically or list them together for chords.
  - **Chord Example**: For a simple triad, C+E+G would be notated as "C E G".

### 6. Rests:
- Rests can be notated by a "R" followed by a number to indicate silence duration.
  - **Rest Example**: "R2" represents a rest of 2 beats.

### 7. Dynamics and Articulations (Suggested Implementation):
- Nouvo primarily focuses on pitch and rhythm. For dynamics (loudness) and articulation (the way notes are played), simple annotations next to notes can be used:
  - "p" for soft (piano).
  - "f" for loud (forte).
  - ">" for accentuated notes.

### 8. Repeats and Structures:
- Use traditional symbols like repeat signs or write out repeated sections. Label parts (A, B, etc.) for clarity in structure.

## Practical Examples

**Simple Melody**:
- A2 B2 C2 D2 E2
  - A melody ascending the Nouvo scale.

**Chord Progression**:
- C+E+G (C Major)
- A+C+E (A Minor)
  - Play each chord for 4 beats: "C+E+G4 A+C+E4"

**Full Piece Structure**:
- Verse: A2 B2 C2 D2 | Chorus: D2 E2 D2 C2 | Verse | Chorus

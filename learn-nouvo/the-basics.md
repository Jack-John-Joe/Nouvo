# Basics to Nouvo.
Nouvo is based on a staff with letters, just like the normal musical system.
Except, this one is easier to read. Here's the staff. [Staff](https://github.com/Jack-John-Joe/Nouvo/assets/131839749/ef006d66-0c8c-4fa8-b5af-2f61bfea4664)
Seems complicated, right?
Nope!
It's even numbered! The 1st gap between the lines is A, and so on from A to E!

A is the highest pitch, while E is the lowest.
What about in-between?
Just add an F on the end! AF is the same as in-between A and B! Simple, right?

And, who needs a time signature?
Well, what about beats?
Basically, just put a number on the end!
For example, A2 is holding out A for 2 beats!
A beat is 1 second.
Time Signatures, Measures, all overcomplicated.
All this info, is enough to read. We'll supply some guides for instruments, and more, to learn playing an instrument with Nouvo.

Happy Nouvo-ing!
